## 💡 **About This Project**

I built this project to explore creative ways of presenting my favorite anime series.  
Inspired by bold title cards and character showcases, I integrated **GSAP** for advanced text and image animations, ensuring each hover interaction feels lively and unique.  

The gallery uses a high-contrast color palette designed for dark mode, and it’s fully responsive and accessible — providing a smooth experience across devices and for screen readers.
